AI unveiled: a game to discover patterns, shape patterns in AI systems

The aim of this project is to create a game for users to learn how to discover how AI systems behave in their interactions.

Part of the MozFest Building Trustworthy AI Working Groups

## Problem ##
Automated Decision Making Systems are often opaque and surrounded by a halo of technomysticism that renders users virtually powerless to effectively question them. 

## Solution ##
Demistify Automated Decision Making Systems via a game that will bring users to discover the patterns underlying the behaviour of the system. The game will be organized in levels of increasing complexity in the patterns governing the system responses. 

Initially, we are thinking about a recommender system. Further developments involve other kinds of predictive systems, and feeding examples or rules to the system to modify its behavior. The user will be able to explore the examples and rules and to modify them in a guided way.
